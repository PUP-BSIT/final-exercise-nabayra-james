			<p>When I was in Grade 10, I was contemplating which track
				or strand to choose when I reached Grade 11 or entered
				senior high school. Based on my National Achievement Test
				(NAT) results, I scored high in the HUMSS strand, which
				focuses more on social interaction and public speaking—
				a result that resonated with my existing skills. 
				However, I carefully considered my family, myself, and 
				various factors before deciding on a strand. I sought 
				advice from relatives, those close to me, and people in my
				surroundings. I thought not only about where I excelled but
				also about securing a future for my loved ones and ensuring
				my personal satisfaction. I thought deeply about the chosen
				strand because I wanted the course I would take in senior
				high school to align with my college course, providing me
				with a background in the field. That led me to choose the
				TVL track with a focus on ICT (Information and
				Communications Technology). There were many reasons behind
				this decision. As I assessed myself, I felt excited and 
				genuinely interested in learning from our teachers. 
				I tracked my progress from Grade 11 to Grade 12. 
				While I may not have been exceptional, I kept up, and that
				was the most crucial aspect. In Grade 11, I ranked fourth 
				in our strand, and in Grade 12, I rebounded to become the
				top student in our strand. It's amusing to think that I
				excelled in the chosen strand and even managed to help
				classmates despite facing challenges. 
				This led me to exclaim, "I can actually do this,
				I can handle college."</p>
			<p>Entering college during a pandemic, I did not expect to pass
				the entrance exam at PUP-T as one of the BSIT students.
				I pushed for it because it was my dream course, and the 
				school I entered was reputable. I was taken aback when
				I saw the knowledge level of my classmates. I struggled
				to keep up because it seemed like they already had advanced
				knowledge about our course. Despite being the top-performing
				student in Grade 12, my knowledge was insufficient.
				The college environment was vastly different, and
				I had to help myself rise to the challenges posed by
				our professors. The first year, particularly the
				first semester, was extremely tough for me because
				I was still trying to find my way. It felt like
				I had no knowledge of what was happening around me.
				I felt small because I had limited knowledge of coding
				in various programming languages. We faced hardships due
				to the workloads assigned by one of our professors. 
				But I knew he gave us those tasks to learn early.
				I felt pressured with each assignment.
				However, as the second semester passed,
				I began to notice growth within myself.
				Then came the vacation, and I contemplated shifting
				to another course, specifically BSBA-HRM, just to escape the
				BSIT course. Unfortunately, there were no available slots in
				other courses, so I fought through the first semester of the
				second year. I decided to try again in the second semester,
				even though they said it was not allowed, and I should have
				shifted during the first semester. But I said,
				"Whatever, I'll fight until the end."
				And here I am now, continuing to pursue my
				"DREAM COURSE."</p>
			<p>I have stumbled many times in this course, but I have also
				fought and persevered. I won't give up until I achieve my
				aspirations. I want to become an IT Professional someday.
				I want a role that doesn't involve too much coding because
				IT is not all about code. I admit I'm not particularly
				skilled in coding, and up until now, I still feel like
				I'm lost and fumbling in the dark. But I am here,
				and I will see this through to the end. I may get tired,
				but I won't give up.</p>
			<p>I want to land a position in good companies or even
				not-so-good ones, as long as I fulfill my dream so that all
				the hardships, pressure, and challenges I've experienced,
				am experiencing, and will experience will be worth it.
				I can't just give up suddenly. I know there's a reason why
				destiny did not transfer me to another course despite
				multiple attempts. I know I am on this path
				because the Lord knows I am on the right track.
				I will continue what I started. "Giving up" is not in my
				vocabulary. Yes, there are times when I feel like letting
				go because it seems like I'm not good at coding.
				I don't know much about what is being taught.
				I feel like a lost child wandering off the path.
				But I know myself. I know I will do everything to succeed in
				the field I have chosen. Despite the challenges,
				I will persevere because I have a dream, and that dream is
				not just a dream. I will experience it when the 
				time is right. I am here, and I will continue 
				this journey.</p>
			<p>I'll revisit this after 5 years, and I know I'll
				smile at what I wrote here because I've achieved
				what I needed to do in life. I'm aware that I'll be busy
				by then, as I can see myself becoming a workaholic person.
				James is diligent. I envision that you have a beautiful
				home, a comfortable life, and have become an
				IT Professional. I know you've gone through a lot,
				embraced it, and you're here now. You've experienced the
				life you wanted. That fatigue you'll feel as you read
				this comes from hard work for yourself and your beloved
				family. You have many responsibilities for your family
				because you're the breadwinner now.
				Remember to take a break! You deserve it!
				Don't abuse yourself. You'll read this in 2028.
				I'm doing many things right and striving now to get us to
				where you are, so don't forget that it's still a long way,
				but you're already far!</p>
